Contact Apk is an android application that I developed using Kotlin and Gradle in Android Studio. It showcases the use of Scroll View, Recycler View, and other components to create a user-friendly interface. The application displays a list of dummy contacts with their names and photos. When the user taps on a contact, it opens a detail page that shows more information about the person, such as phone number and description. The application also has an About Page that introduces my profile. This is my first android application and I hope you find it useful and interesting.
